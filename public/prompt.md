Design a modern doctor dashboard UI for a healthcare SaaS platform, optimized exclusively for dark mode. The layout should be responsive, clean, and focused on outpatient clinic workflows. It should replace the old dashboard structure.

Sidebar Navigation (left-aligned):
Include these menu items:

Overview

Appointments

Patient Queue

Earnings

Reviews

The sidebar should be collapsible, minimal, and highlight the active section clearly.

Overview Page (Main Dashboard):

Top Summary Cards:
Display 4 key metrics:

Today’s Appointments

Patients in Queue

Today's Earnings

Average Wait Time

Live Patient Queue:
Show real-time queue of waiting patients with their name, visit reason, wait time, and buttons like “Start”, “Skip”, or “Mark as Done”.

Appointments Section:
Show a list or calendar view of today’s and upcoming appointments. Include patient name, time, and visit type. Add filtering by time or type.

Earnings Section:
Display total earnings for the current week/month. Include a simple graph to show trends and a list of recent payouts.

Reviews Section:
Show recent patient feedback with star ratings, patient names, and short comments. Include actions to reply or flag.

Recent Activity Feed:
Display a scrolling log of events like new patient registrations, appointment changes, or new reviews.

Design Guidelines:

Dark mode only

Clear visual hierarchy and spacing

Modern fonts and clean layout

Responsive and easy to navigate

Prioritize clarity, speed, and minimal distractions

The dashboard should feel intuitive and efficient for doctors managing daily outpatient clinic tasks."
